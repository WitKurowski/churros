# Contribute

We aim to foster a healthy, inclusive, organized and efficient community around the Churros project. We believe in prioritization, responsiveness, thoroughness, and helping others. GitHub issue tracking and our state of the art model tracking will help us achieve the shared goal of making Churros be as helpful as possible to the android community. Below we outline what’s involved in different aspects of contribution.

### Contributor License Agreement ("CLA")

In order to accept your pull request, we need you to submit a CLA. Once you complete your CLA, then it is valid for all future contributions you make to this repository.

### Filing an issue (Bug or Enhancement)

Please create an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/galcantara-asapp/churros/issues).

### Fixing a bug (PR, etc.)

Open an issue for the bug if one doesn’t exist. Then work on cut your own branch from master with the following naming convention: issue-###_short-desc_github-handle, using the issue number for the relevant bug. Once you have finished your work on your branch (and ideally added new tests to catch the bug!), you can open a PR against master. The PR will be reviewed and merged, and ultimately included in a future release (see next section).

If your bug fix does not follow our style and contribution guidelines, you will have to make the necessary changes before we can accept the PR. Further, you can expect at least 1 review from the Churros team where we will check for code quality.

### Release Cycle

We aim to release patches at least once a week, but currently follow no other regular cycles or sprint schedules.
